# Case Study

1. Your organisation would like to offer their employees an allowance to live a healthier lifestyle, and improve the physical health of their employees.
However, the organisation cannot afford to give this allowance to all employees and have requested the data science team to help identify the employees
that will benefit most from this.


2. The data science team conducted research and found a dataset on the internet, that they believe can help them predict if someone 
is at risk for heart disease or not, which they believe will be a good indicator of employees that will benefit from this health-allowance .
    
3. The dataset that they found was collected by asking the following questions to a certain group of people:
    
- `HeartDisease`:	Respondents that have ever reported having coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI)
- `BMI`:	Body Mass Index (BMI)
- `Smoking`:	Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life? [Note: 5 packs = 100 cigarettes]
- `AlcoholDrinking`:	Heavy drinkers (adult men having more than 14 drinks per week and adult women having more than 7 drinks per week
- `Stroke`:	(Ever told) (you had) a stroke?
- `PhysicalHealth`:	Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good? (0-30 days)
- `ID`:	Survey question unique identifier
- `MentalHealth`:	Thinking about your mental health, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? (0-30 days)
- `DiffWalking`:	Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?
- `Income`: What is your monthly income/salary?	
- `Sex`:	Are you male or female?
- `AgeCategory`:	Fourteen-level age category
